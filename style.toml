	# There are 3 ways to select a color:
	# - The 16 base colors are selected by name:
	#       "blue", "light red", "magenta", ...
	# - Low-resolution colors use 3 characters, each <= 5:
	#       "541", "003", ...
	# - Full-resolution colors start with '#' and can be 3 or 6 hex digits:
	#       "#1A6", "#123456", ...

	# If the value is an array, the first valid
	# and supported color will be used.
